# README

This code theme is inspired by the astronaut suits in the [Lost in Space](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5232792/) reboot TV series.  It's a light theme with emphasis on steel with burnt orange accents.  Code is intentionally fairly monochromatic to make it easier to focus when writing/reading.
